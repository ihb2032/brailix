"""Resource-consistency guards — the backend's last-resort warnings for an
internally inconsistent resource table.

These fire when a symbol resolves to cells but carries no role, or when the
dispatcher asks for a music entity the table doesn't have. The profile
validator forbids both for shipped profiles (math roles are required; the
shipped music tables are complete), so they are only reachable with a
hand-edited / corrupted resource JSON. The inconsistency is injected here (a
role stripped, a topic dropped — at the class level so the frozen profile
instance is untouched) so the warning, and for rests the fallback cell, has
behaviour coverage, not just an i18n string.
