"""Shared fixtures for the golden test suite.

The ``pipe`` fixture is module-scoped (not session-scoped) so each test
file constructs the Pipeline once but the underlying registries stay
clean between files.

The golden corpus is locked against the **jieba + pypinyin** pair —
that's the closest "real user" setup available without dragging in
HanLP / g2pw (which need bigger models and Python 3.11+ in some
transitive deps). jieba is required for the goldens: if it's missing
the whole suite skips, exactly the way we skip on missing
``latex2mathml``.

    """One Pipeline per test module — cheap to construct, kept hot for
    a file's cases to avoid re-loading profile JSON on every test.

    We pin **both** the Chinese analyzer (``"jieba"``) and the pinyin
    resolver (``"pypinyin"``) so the output is deterministic regardless
    of which optional packages are installed and regardless of how
    other tests in the suite monkeypatch ``sys.modules``. The default
    ``"auto"`` selection cascade would otherwise depend on package
    availability and on cached registry state that earlier-running
    tests can taint (e.g. by stuffing a fake ``pypinyin`` module into
    the registry cache).

    To keep insulation tight we also clear the resolver / analyzer
    registries at the start of every test that uses the ``pipe``
    fixture — see the autouse fixture below.
