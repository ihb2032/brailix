"""Shared letter-sign (case / script-class prefix) rule.

The case/script sign is written before
the letter; consecutive letters of the SAME class (small/capital Latin,
small/capital Greek) share one sign — only the first letter of the run
takes it; a class change starts a new sign. So ``Abc`` → ⠠⠁⠰⠃⠉ and
``πr`` → ⠨⠏⠰⠗, and the class change is what keeps mixed-case units
(``mW`` → ⠰⠍⠠⠺) lossless.

On top of that rule sits the whole-word-capitals convention: an
all-capital Latin run of two or more letters doubles the capital sign
(``ABC`` → ⠠⠠⠁⠃⠉), after which the letters are written bare. A single
⠠ then unambiguously means "only the first letter is capital".

Consumers: the math identifier emitter
(``backend.math.handlers.leaves._emit_letter_runs``), the quantity-unit
emitter (``backend.number.translate_quantity``), and the Latin text
backend's whole-word-capitals branch (``backend.latin``).
