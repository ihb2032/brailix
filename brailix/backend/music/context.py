"""Mutable per-score state for the music backend.

The translator threads one :class:`MusicBrailleContext` instance
through a single :class:`~brailix.ir.inline.MusicInline` translation.
The entry point in :mod:`brailix.backend.music` constructs a fresh
context per node so state never leaks across scores.

    * ``span`` — the source span of the current score root or a
      narrower span pushed down by data-bk-span (M3+).
    * ``prev_pitch`` — the previous note's ``(step, octave)`` tuple,
      used by BANA Par. 3.2.2 octave inference. ``None`` means "first
      note of line" — the next octave prefix is always emitted.
    * ``octave_rule`` — strategy override. ``"interval16"`` is the
      BANA default (skip-based inference); ``"every_measure"`` resets
      ``prev_pitch`` at every measure boundary; ``"always"`` resets
      before every note so an octave prefix is always emitted (useful
      for teaching / strict facsimile).
