"""Parse a numeric-tone pinyin syllable into (initial, final, tone).

The Chinese braille backend looks up cells by **phonological**
initial + final, not by orthographic spelling. So we need to undo
the cosmetic ``w``/``y`` rules that pinyin uses for syllables that
start with a glide vowel:

* ``wu`` → no-initial + ``u``
* ``wa`` → no-initial + ``ua``
* ``yi`` → no-initial + ``i``
* ``yan`` → no-initial + ``ian``
* ``yu`` → no-initial + ``ü``
* ``yue`` → no-initial + ``üe``

Plus the standard pinyin contractions:

* ``ju`` ``qu`` ``xu`` (and derivatives) → ``j``/``q``/``x`` + ``ü...``
* ``iu`` → ``iou``
* ``ui`` → ``uei``
* ``un`` → ``uen``

The parser is intentionally a pure function — no profile or
context — so it can be tested exhaustively.
