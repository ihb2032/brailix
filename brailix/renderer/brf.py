"""Render BrailleIR as Braille Ready Format (BRF) bytes.

BRF is the publishing-grade exchange format used by embossers and
braille translation chains. Each braille cell maps to one ASCII
character per the **North American Braille ASCII Code** (NABCC, ANSI/
NBA-Braille):

  ``mask`` = bitmask of dots 1..6 (``dot N -> 1 << (N-1)``)
  ``char`` = ``_NABCC[mask]``

Mapping table (64 entries; the same one that every BRF embosser
implements). For example::

  dots ()      → ' '   blank cell
  dots (1,)    → 'A'
  dots (1,2)   → 'B'
  dots (3,4,5,6) → '#'

Eight-dot cells: BRF was defined for the 6-dot system, so dots 7 / 8
have no standard ASCII representation. The renderer **strips** them
silently — emitting a warning would be too noisy when 8-dot data is
intentionally being downgraded for embossing.

Line endings follow the BRF spec: each braille block ends with CR/LF
(``b"\\r\\n"``) and an optional form-feed at page breaks (handled by
the layout pass — this renderer only emits block-level CR/LF).

The output type is ``bytes`` — BRF files are conventionally written
in binary mode to preserve the CR/LF endings on every platform.
