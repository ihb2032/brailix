"""Layout renderer: word-wrap, block indent, optional pagination.

Where :mod:`renderer.unicode_braille` and :mod:`renderer.brf` produce
one long line per block, this renderer makes the output **page-ready**:
line-wrapped at a configurable cell width, indented per block type,
and optionally paginated.

Output formats:

* ``"unicode"`` (default) — a ``str`` of Unicode braille separated by
  ``\\n`` between lines and (when paginated) ``\\x0c`` (form feed)
  between pages. Suits screen reading and copy-paste into editors.
* ``"brf"`` — ``bytes`` in the BRF (NABCC ASCII) encoding, ``\\r\\n``
  line ends per the BRF spec, form feed between pages. Suits sending
  straight to an embosser or saving a ``.brf`` file.

Block-level rules (defaults; per-block overrides via :class:`LayoutOptions`):

* ``paragraph``  — first-line indent 2 cells, continuation flush left.
* ``heading``    — one blank line before and after; level-1 centred,
  deeper levels flush left with no indent.
* ``list_item``  — first line flush left, continuation indented 2 cells
  (hanging indent past the marker that the backend already emitted).
* ``quote``      — entire block indented 2 cells.
* ``code_block`` — emit verbatim (no wrapping, no indent).
* ``table_row``  — emit verbatim (column alignment is the backend's job).
* ``footnote``   — first line flush left, continuation indented 2.
* ``score`` / ``music_block`` — laid out by the active BANA *format*
  (:mod:`brailix.renderer.music_layout`, chosen via
  :attr:`LayoutOptions.music_scheme`).  The default ``single_line``
  (BANA §24.1) breaks only at measure-separator cells, never mid-measure
  (BANA Pars. 11 / 17) and never hyphenates; a measure too wide for the
  line runs over.  ``score`` is framed with one blank line before and
  after, ``music_block`` none.

Any text block may additionally carry a source-declared **alignment**
(:attr:`BrailleBlock.align` — ``"center"`` / ``"right"``, e.g. a Word
paragraph the author centred or right-aligned). When set it overrides the
block's usual first-line / hanging indent: every wrapped line is left-padded
from the line width so its content sits centred or flush right. This is the
same mechanism that centres level-1 headings — that default is just the
``align``-less fallback applied to ``heading`` level 1.

Wrapping picks blank cells as break points (word boundaries) — and
when a single "word" (run of non-blank cells) doesn't fit, breaks at
**atomic-group** boundaries inside it: cells that share the same
non-None ``source_span`` are one atom (one hanzi syllable / a Latin
first-letter prefix+letter / cells inside the same math structure all
share a span), and a cell with ``source_span=None`` (synthesised marker
like ``number_sign`` / ``list_marker``) clings to its right-hand
neighbour so it never floats off alone. Each non-blank break injects a
**continuation hyphen** at the end of the broken line — defaults to ⠤
(dots 3-6), per the BANA / Current Chinese Braille / NCB convention,
shared by Chinese and English embedded text. Set
``LayoutOptions.continuation_hyphen=None`` to disable.

If a single atom itself is wider than the line we still mid-atom break
as a last resort (silently — the user would already see the runaway
output and can restructure the source).

Pagination: if ``page_height`` is set, every ``page_height`` rendered
lines emit a form feed character. Blank-line separators count toward
the page budget. ``None`` (default) means single continuous output.

      truncate ``target_line`` from the colliding edge (tail when
