"""Inline-math island codec — the lingua franca for *deferred* inline math.

When the input layer extracts an inline math fragment from a host
document (Word OMML, a legacy EQ field, ...) it does **not** convert it.
Instead it embeds the *raw* fragment, tagged with its source dialect, as
a text *island* inside the surrounding paragraph's ``Block.text``. The
frontend's math pass (:func:`brailix.frontend.math.parse_math_tree`,
driven from ``Pipeline._attach_math``) then converts that island exactly
as it converts a user-typed ``$...$`` fragment — so the input layer never
imports the math frontend, and inline math defers just like a display
:class:`~brailix.ir.document.MathBlock` does.

This module is the single definition of the island wire format. It is
imported by both the writer (:mod:`brailix.input.docx`) and the reader
(:mod:`brailix.frontend.normalize`); neither imports the other, and the
``$...$`` convention is no longer duplicated knowledge spread across the
two layers.

Format
------
A tagged island is::

    "$" + US + source + US + payload + "$"

where ``US`` is the ASCII Unit Separator (``\\x1d``). The payload has its
whitespace runs flattened to single spaces and every literal ``$``
replaced by the ASCII Record Separator (``\\x1e``).

Two design points make this safe:

* The leading ``$`` keeps a tagged island lexically a ``$...$`` region,
  so the segmenter recognises it through its existing protected-region
  scan (``frontend.segment._INLINE_MATH_RE``) with no new pattern. The
  ``US`` immediately after the ``$`` is the single discriminator between
  a *tagged* island (decoded here) and a plain user-typed ``$x^2$`` /
  ``$<math>...$`` fragment (handled by the normalizer's LaTeX/MathML
  sniff).
* ``US`` and ``RS`` are both illegal in XML 1.0 character data and never
  appear in Word EQ-field text, so they delimit and escape with no risk
  of colliding with real payload content. Flattening newlines and
  escaping ``$`` is what lets the island survive that segmenter scan,
  whose regex rejects an inner ``$`` or newline.

The escaping is transport-level and fully reversed by :func:`unwrap`, so
the source adapter downstream receives the byte-for-byte original payload
(a real ``$``, not an XML character reference).
