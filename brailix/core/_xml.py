These tidy a parsed :class:`~xml.etree.ElementTree.Element` tree at a
layer boundary: drop XML namespaces so a backend can match bare local
tags, null out pure-whitespace ``text`` / ``tail`` nodes that confuse
element iteration, and scrub characters illegal in XML 1.0 before a
(possibly malformed) vendor string is echoed back into a soft-failure
document. They depend only on the standard library, so they live in
:mod:`brailix.core` — the frontend normalizers (MathML / MusicXML) and
the input layer's docx converters both use them without either layer
