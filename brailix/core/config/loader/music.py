"""Music tables loader (BANA 2015 Music Braille Code).

Music resources live in ``resources/music/<topic>.json``. Each file has
one body key (the topic name, e.g. ``"notes"``) whose value is a dict
of entity name -> entry. Each entry's ``cells`` is a list of cell refs
from ``resources/cells.json`` (e.g. ``"c_13456"``) plus the sentinel
``"c_blank"`` for an empty cell (BANA prints two cell groups with an
internal space character).

Subdirectories: ``tables.music`` values can be either a file path
(``"resources/music/notes.json"``) or a directory path (e.g.
``"resources/music/instruments/"``) — in the latter case every JSON
file inside is loaded under the ``<prefix>.<filename>`` topic key.
