"""NCB (National Common Braille / GF0019-2018) profile data shape.

Single :class:`NcbExceptions` container with three sub-records:
``tone_omission`` (per-initial tone-omission rules),
``char_overrides`` (character-level overrides), and
``word_overrides`` (word-level tone retention).  All three are
loaded from one resource file —
``resources/cn/ncb/exceptions.json`` — following the design principle that
*all NCB-specific difference lives in one consolidated "exceptions"
resource* so the backend stays small and generic.

This module is in the config layer because the data shapes are
**profile data**, not backend behavior.  The lookup methods on these
classes are pure dict access — small enough to live on the dataclass.
The actual tone-emission decision algorithm lives in
:mod:`brailix.backend.zh.tone.ncb_omission` because it's behavior.

Layering rule: this module imports nothing from :mod:`brailix.backend`.
That's why :meth:`NcbCharOverrides.shorthand_cells_for` takes a plain
``next_is_zero_initial: bool`` instead of a ``ParsedPinyin`` —
backend computes the bool from its parser and passes it in.

JSON layout convention (since 2026-05-25): char/word entries are
**arrays of objects** with explicit ``surface`` fields and ASCII
``_id`` slugs, *not* dicts keyed by Chinese chars.  Editing, grep,
and diff stay keyboard-friendly.  Loader translates to
``dict[surface, ...]`` for the backend.  Same rationale as the
math-symbol entity-name convention in ``ARCHITECTURE.md``:
ASCII keys = ergonomic tooling.
