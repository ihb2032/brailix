"""Generic lazy-loading registry for pluggable adapters.

Every pluggable subsystem (zh analyzer, pinyin resolver, math source
adapter, ...) maintains an instance of :class:`Registry`. Adapters
register a **loader callable**, not the instance itself, so that the
underlying third-party library (HanLP, g2pW, latex2mathml, ...) is
imported only when the adapter is first requested.

A loader that fails with :class:`ImportError` is reported as a
:class:`MissingExtraError` carrying the pip extras hint the user needs.

The registry can also validate that loaded instances conform to a
:func:`typing.runtime_checkable` Protocol, catching adapter authors
who forget required methods.
