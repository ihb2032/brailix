"""Plain-text input adapter: wrap a string as a :class:`DocumentIR`,
one :class:`Paragraph` per source line.

Plain text has no soft-wrap convention: unlike Markdown (where a single
newline is presentation, joined into the paragraph as a space), a
newline in a ``.txt`` file is the author's layout intent — Chinese
documents conventionally put one paragraph per line, and poetry / song
lyrics put one verse per line. So **every** newline is a paragraph
boundary here, and the braille output breaks where the source breaks.
Blank lines contribute no block of their own (braille paragraphs are
distinguished by the layout's first-line indent, not by blank lines),
so runs of newlines just collapse. Markdown sources wanting the
join-on-single-newline behaviour go through
:mod:`brailix.input.markdown` instead.

Splitting into blocks (rather than one monolithic block holding the
whole file) lets a front-end compile, cache, and re-render a large
document one line at a time instead of recompiling the whole thing
on every edit — the incremental-compilation pattern (see ARCHITECTURE
§9.1). Each block carries an exact :class:`Span` back into the source so
per-cell proofread mapping stays aligned.
