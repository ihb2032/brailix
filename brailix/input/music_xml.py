"""Music score file input adapters.

Read a score file from disk and wrap it as a single-block
:class:`DocumentIR` carrying a :class:`ScoreBlock`. Two entry points,
split by how the source reaches MusicXML:

:func:`parse_musicxml` — the MusicXML family (no adapter needed):

* ``.musicxml`` / ``.xml`` → read UTF-8 text, ``source="musicxml"``
* ``.mxl``                → ZIP container, unzipped via the existing
  frontend :class:`~brailix.frontend.music.adapters.mxl.MxlSourceAdapter`
  to extract the inner XML, then ``source="musicxml"`` (the
  decompressed text is plain MusicXML so the backend doesn't need to
  re-unzip later).

:func:`parse_score_file` — formats that need a source adapter to reach
MusicXML:

* ``.mid`` / ``.midi`` → MIDI bytes converted via the ``midi`` adapter
  (needs the ``midi`` extra)
* ``.abc``            → ABC text converted via the ``abc`` adapter
  (needs the ``abc`` extra)

Both store the resulting MusicXML string as the block's ``text`` with
``source="musicxml"`` (conversion is eager, at input time, exactly as
``.mxl`` is); ``Pipeline._populate_music_block`` then parses that text
through the music frontend → MusicInline + ET.Element tree.

Neither opens .sib / .musx / .dorico / .mscz — proprietary formats stay
outside brailix per ``ARCHITECTURE.md``
