"""Input layer: document source → :class:`DocumentIR`.

Each adapter parses one source format (plain text, Markdown, Word
``.docx``, MusicXML, ...) and produces a
:class:`~brailix.ir.document.DocumentIR` with block-level structure
populated. Inline content stays as raw ``Block.text`` until the
Pipeline's frontend runs over it.

Embedded foreign math / music sources follow one boundary rule
(ARCHITECTURE §1). A **text** dialect (Word OMML / EQ field) is left raw
and deferred to the frontend — inline ones travel as a source-tagged
island (:mod:`brailix.core.inline_math`) inside ``Block.text``, block
ones as ``MathBlock(source=...)``. A **binary** dialect (MathType MTEF,
MIDI, the ``.mxl`` ZIP) is decoded here at the input boundary, because
the text IR can't carry binary. So this layer imports no math / music
*frontend* for the text dialects; only the binary decoders reach across.

Currently shipping:

* :mod:`brailix.input.plain`    — one paragraph from a string.
* :mod:`brailix.input.markdown` — common Markdown subset
  (headings, paragraphs, ordered / unordered lists, block quotes,
  fenced code blocks, ``$$...$$`` math blocks, ``| col | col |`` tables).
* :mod:`brailix.input.docx`     — Word ``.docx`` / ``.docm`` (modern
  OOXML, incl. OMML / MathType / Equation 3.0 math) and legacy ``.doc``
  via LibreOffice ``soffice``.
* :mod:`brailix.input.music_xml` — score files: ``.musicxml`` / ``.xml``
  / ``.mxl`` directly, and ``.mid`` / ``.midi`` / ``.abc`` converted to
  MusicXML through the matching music source adapter.

To plug in a new format, write an adapter that returns a
``DocumentIR``. Which adapter handles a given file is driven by the
file itself (extension / content), not by the profile — so, unlike
the profile-selected subsystems (zh analyzer, pinyin, math / music
source), this layer keeps no name→implementation registry. Discovery
of *which* formats an application offers (file-dialog filters,
fallback rules, third-party adapters) is an application concern and
lives there: an application can wrap these functions as registered
adapters behind its own registry.

:func:`parse_file` is the in-house convenience dispatcher, so
GUIs / CLIs / scripts don't each reinvent ``read_text + pick parser``.
Its routing is a **data table** (:data:`_FORMAT_ROUTES`) mapping a
suffix set to a handler — adding a built-in format is one more row
plus its ``parse_*`` adapter, not a new branch.

    a ``str``. Callers wanting a non-default mapping (feeding a ``.tex``
    file through the markdown parser, say) should call the underlying
    ``parse_*`` directly after reading the file themselves.

    ``mathtype_fallback`` is forwarded to :func:`parse_docx` for ``.docx`` /
    ``.docm`` (ignored for every other format, the same way
    ``chem_detection`` is). It defaults to ``"off"`` — the native MTEF
    adapter only, so old MTEF files it can't decode come back as
    ``<merror>`` placeholders. Pass ``"auto"`` (or ``"libreoffice"``) to
    engage the LibreOffice safety net, where the document is re-parsed
    through ``soffice`` so the math becomes readable. The default stays
    ``"off"`` so this convenience dispatch never shells out to an external
    converter implicitly; :meth:`brailix.pipeline.Pipeline.parse_file`
    drives the value from the ``input.docx.mathtype_fallback`` profile
    feature.

    Errors propagate as-is: :class:`FileNotFoundError` when ``path``
    doesn't exist, :class:`UnicodeDecodeError` when text bytes aren't
    valid UTF-8, :class:`MissingExtraError` when a needed extra (``docx``
    for Word, ``midi`` / ``abc`` for those score formats) isn't
    installed, :class:`ParseError` for malformed Word documents.
