r"""Microsoft Word input adapter — ``.docx`` / ``.docm`` (modern OOXML)
and ``.doc`` (legacy binary, via external conversion).

`.docx` / `.docm` (modern, ZIP + XML)
    Parsed directly with `python-docx` for paragraph + table walking,
    plus raw lxml access to pick up math (``m:oMath`` /
    ``m:oMathPara``) and list / heading style hints that ``python-docx``
    doesn't model.

`.doc` (legacy, OLE binary)
    Cannot be read in pure Python — we shell out to LibreOffice
    (``soffice --headless --convert-to docx``) to upgrade the file to
    ``.docx`` and then delegate. If LibreOffice (or any registered
    converter) isn't available, :func:`parse_doc` raises a clear
    ``ParseError`` directing the caller to convert manually.

Math handling
    Word stores formulas as OMML (and, for older documents, OLE
    MathType or legacy EQ fields). This adapter follows one rule, the
    same one ARCHITECTURE §1 states for the input/frontend boundary: a
    math source that arrives as **text** is left raw and *deferred* to
    the frontend's math pass; a source that arrives as **binary** is
    decoded here, because the text IR carries no binary payload. So:

    * Display equations (``m:oMathPara``) become a :class:`MathBlock`
      with ``source="omml"`` carrying the raw OMML; the math frontend
      converts it at Pipeline time.
    * Inline equations (``m:oMath`` inside a paragraph) and legacy Word
      EQ fields are wrapped as *deferred* source-tagged inline-math
      islands (:func:`brailix.core.inline_math.wrap`, ``source="omml"``
      / ``"eq_field"``) embedded in the paragraph's text. The frontend's
      segmenter recognises the island as a ``$...$`` region and the
      normalizer decodes the tag, so the matching adapter runs at
      Pipeline time — the same deferral the display path uses, and the
      reason this adapter imports no math frontend for these paths.
    * OLE MathType (``Equation.DSMT4`` / ``Equation.3``) is the binary
      case: its MTEF payload cannot live in the text IR, so it is decoded
      at the input boundary (via the MTEF adapter) and embedded as an
      eager ``$<math>...</math>$`` island. See :mod:`._ole`.
    * Sub/superscript runs (``<w:vertAlign>`` — the Ctrl+= / Ctrl+Shift+=
      shortcuts, or the Font dialog) are not a foreign source dialect at
      all: a maximal cluster of script-bearing runs is *synthesised* into
      an ``<msup>`` / ``<msub>`` MathML tree built here and embedded as a
      ``$<math>...</math>$`` island, so a formula typed as formatted text
      (``x²``, ``H₂O``) is no longer flattened to ``x2`` / ``H2O``. With
      ``chem_detection`` on, a cluster that conservatively reads as a
      chemical formula is tagged ``data-bk-chem`` so the backend applies
      chemistry rules instead of generic math.

The split lets inline math stay inline (no spurious paragraph break)
while making every OMML path — display and inline — defer through the
identical frontend route (:mod:`brailix.frontend.math.adapters.omml`).

To handle both legacy and modern files through one entry point, use
:func:`parse_file` (suffix dispatch); call :func:`parse_docx` or
:func:`parse_doc` directly when the format is already known.

Subpackage layout
    The adapter is split into cohesive helper modules, with the
    orchestration (public entry points + the LibreOffice converter
    resolution that tests monkeypatch) kept here in the package
    ``__init__`` so ``brailix.input.docx.<name>`` stays the stable
    namespace:

    * :mod:`._xml`    — OOXML namespace constants + low-level XML / tag
      / serialisation helpers (the DAG leaf).
    * :mod:`._ole`    — OLE / MTEF payload extraction
      (``_build_ole_blob_map`` and friends); depends on ``._xml``.
    * :mod:`._blocks` — body / paragraph / run / table walking;
      depends on ``._ole`` + ``._xml``.

    ``parse_docx`` / ``parse_doc`` / ``_parse_docx_via_libreoffice`` /
    ``_mtef_recovery_needed`` / ``_resolve_doc_converter`` live here together
    because they call each other as module globals — and the tests
    patch ``brailix.input.docx._resolve_doc_converter`` /
    ``brailix.input.docx.subprocess.run`` in *this* namespace, so the
    patched function and its callers must share it.

    Walks ``document.xml`` in body order so paragraphs, headings,
    lists, tables, and math blocks come out in the same order Word
    shows them. OMML math is preserved either as a dedicated
    :class:`MathBlock` (display equations) or inline ``$<math>...</math>$``
    inside the surrounding paragraph (inline equations). MathType /
    Microsoft Equation 3.0 OLE objects go through
    :class:`~brailix.frontend.math.adapters.mtef.MtefMathSourceAdapter`
    by default; see ``mathtype_fallback`` for the LibreOffice escape
    hatch.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mathtype_fallback
        Strategy for MathType OLE equations the native MTEF adapter
        can't decode:

        * ``"off"`` (default) — accept whatever the native adapter
          produces, including ``<merror>`` placeholders.
        * ``"libreoffice"`` — convert the whole document through
          ``soffice --headless --convert-to docx`` *before* parsing,
          which rewrites MathType OLE into native OMML. Slower and
          requires LibreOffice on PATH (or override via the
          environment-resolved converter).
        * ``"auto"`` — parse natively first; if the document contains
          OLE equations AND all of them failed, retry once through
          LibreOffice. Combines the speed of the native adapter with
          a safety net for old MTEF v3 / v4 files our coverage misses.
    chem_detection
        When ``True``, a sub/superscript cluster that conservatively reads
        as a chemical formula (real element signature: a multi-letter
        element, ≥2 elements, a charge, or a state label) is translated as
        chemistry (``data-bk-chem``) instead of generic math. Off by
        default because a lone single-letter variable subscript (``V₁``)
        coincides with an element symbol and can't be told apart from a
        formula by structure alone — the caller (Pipeline) turns it on from
        the ``input.docx.detect_chemistry`` profile feature.

    Raises
    ------
