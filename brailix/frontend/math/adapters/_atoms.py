"""Shared lexer that splits a literal text run into MathML leaf atoms.

The OMML, MTEF, and EQ-field adapters all face the same sub-problem: a run
of plain text (``2x+1``, a Word ``<m:t>`` payload, an accumulated MTEF
CHAR stream) must become ``<mn>`` / ``<mi>`` / ``<mo>`` atoms so the math
backend can apply per-class rules (number sign, identifier style, ...).
They used to carry three near-identical copies that had drifted — different
operator sets, different comma handling. This is the one implementation.

The single genuine source-format difference is whether ``,`` groups inside
a number: OMML / MTEF text can carry thousands-grouped numbers (``1,234``),
whereas in EQ-field syntax ``,`` is the argument separator and must never be
swallowed into a number (``\\f(1,2)`` is two operands). That difference is
the explicit ``comma_in_number`` flag, not accidental drift.
