"""MathML normalization.

After a source adapter produces a MathML string, the normalizer cleans
it up so downstream consumers (the math backend) have fewer special
cases to handle:

* strip leading / trailing whitespace text nodes inside element runs;
* collapse single-child ``<mrow>`` wrappers (``<mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow>``
  → ``<mi>x</mi>``);
* neutralise presentational wrappers: ``<mstyle>`` / ``<mpadded>``
  (typographic hints only — latex2mathml wraps every ``\\displaystyle``
  formula in one) are renamed to ``<mrow>`` so their content keeps
  flowing through ordinary dispatch, and ``<mspace>`` / ``<mphantom>``
  (print-space occupiers with no braille meaning) are removed;
* drop invisible-operator ``<mo>`` elements (U+2061 function application
  / U+2062 invisible times / U+2063 invisible separator / U+2064
  invisible plus — the OMML ``m:func`` adapter emits U+2061): they
  render as nothing in print and braille alike, and removing them keeps
  sibling shapes uniform for the backend (a function name directly
  precedes its argument);
* drop the MathML XML namespace from every element tag so callers can
  match on bare local names (``mi``, ``mrow``, ...) instead of
  Clark-notation names.

The normalizer never raises — malformed input is wrapped into a single
``<merror>`` and returned. The backend turns that into an unknown cell
with a ``MATH_ERROR`` warning and the pipeline keeps running.

**Attribute preservation**: the normalizer rewrites ``elem.tag`` (to
drop namespaces) but never touches ``elem.attrib``. Any
``data-bk-*`` provenance attribute set by an adapter (e.g.
``data-bk-span="3,4"`` for sub-element source spans, see
``ARCHITECTURE.md``) survives normalization untouched.

      ``<mrow>`` — the wrapped content keeps its grouping and flows

      ``\\displaystyle`` formula in ``<mstyle>``; before this rename
      the whole formula collapsed into a single unknown cell.
      Presentational attributes are dropped; ``data-bk-*`` provenance
      attributes (if an adapter ever sets them here) are kept.
    * ``<mspace>`` / ``<mphantom>`` exist to occupy *print* space —
      braille has no use for either (operator spacing is the backend's

      content included (it is invisible by definition). The one
      exception is ``<mspace linebreak="newline">`` — latex2mathml's
