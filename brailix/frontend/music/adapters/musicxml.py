"""Pass-through MusicXML adapter.

Input is already MusicXML, so the adapter only validates that the
string parses as well-formed XML and returns it. Malformed input is
wrapped inside a single ``<music-error>`` document so the normalizer +
backend produce a clean ``MUSIC_PARSE_RECOVERY`` warning rather than
crashing.

The :func:`music_error_wrap` helper is also imported by the
normalizer and used by sibling adapters (``mxl`` / ``plain``) for
soft-failure reporting — exposed at module level for that reason.
